Yes, it is energizing at first and you may need to take an extra amount of benzo to calm you down, but the side effects eventually go away for some of us, although it seems like they never will for weeks.

The most effective treatment to date has been a combination of Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. I took that combination for ten+ years and unfortunately I recently started slipping downward, increased depression and feeling out of control.  I  was prescribed Fetzima (transitioned off Cymbalta) and completed the starter pack with the only benefit being increased energy. My Dr then increased the doseage to 80mg and have been at 80mg for two + weeks.  I have never felt (for lack of a better word) so crazy in my life!

I was sick and drained.  Effexor didn't have that issue, just some nausea and I did feel energized, but it would take me 10 minutes to urinate.  Fetzima was my 20th antidepressant.  I am looking into a clinical trial of ECT and Ketamine.  I am over those useless medicines.  I can't believe this garbage retails for 400/mo.
